# Customer-Clustering-Prediction

A machine learning backend I built for Proximity Insight LLC which extracts, parses and clusters millions of their customers. This analysis is then fed into support vector machines which are used to predict the future value of customers. At the time that I built the program it was __used to predict the value of over 8 million customers which directly influenced the business' strategy and marketing.__
